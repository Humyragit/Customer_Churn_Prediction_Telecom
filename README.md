# Customer_Churn_Prediction_Telecom
Predicting telecom customer churn using Python and Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, EDA, and Insights)

📞 Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecom Company
🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the company) based on their demographic and usage data. The analysis helps telecom businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

📊 Dataset

Name: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Source: IBM Sample Dataset (Kaggle)

Rows: 7,043

Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

🧠 Project Steps

Data Loading & Cleaning:
Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted categorical data into numerical form.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized customer tenure, contract type, and service usage to identify churn patterns.

Feature Engineering:
Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features.

Model Building:

Logistic Regression (Baseline Model)

Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model Performance:

✅ Accuracy: ~80%

✅ Confusion Matrix and Classification Report generated

✅ Identified top churn factors

🔍 Key Insights

Customers with month-to-month contracts are more likely to churn.

Higher churn is observed among customers without online security or tech support.

Long-term customers (tenure > 40 months) are less likely to churn.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python, Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn, Google Colab

📈 Results

The logistic regression model successfully predicted churn with ~80% accuracy. Visualizations highlighted key drivers influencing customer retention.
